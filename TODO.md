# Ideas / things to do

* Minify+inline CSS/JS as a build process
* Add some explanation text (e.g. an "About" section)
* Auto-complete for property names
* More details for partially-animated properties like font
* More details about _how_ a property is animated
    * Details of how values are interpolated
    * Visual timeline of change in value over time (taken from [The Sneetches and other DevTools](https://shoehornwithteeth.com/ramblings/2014/08/the-sneetches-and-other-devtools/) prototype)
    * Example element animation
* Allow expansion of sub-properties, e.g. `border` expands to `border-width` and `border-color`, which can also expand
* URL permalinks
* Use Open Search protocol for searching from the address bar (requires URL permalinks)
* A compatibility matrix for browser support of animating certain properties, like @kangax's ES5 support matrix.
* Easter eggs (re-animate corpses)
* Add special case for `background-image`
